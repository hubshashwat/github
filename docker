q: why do u need docker?
a: diff os, diff versions in dependencies, long setup time for different dev/test/prod env

a: docker leverages containers  


docker run container_name -> start a container
docker ps -> list all containers that are running
docker ps -a --> shows even the stopped containers
docker stop container_name -> stop a container
docker rm container_name -> remove a container from memory
docker images -> list all images of docker
docker rmi image_name -> remove a image
